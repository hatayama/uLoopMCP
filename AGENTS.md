## CLI Skills

Skills in `Packages/src/Cli~/src/skills/skill-definitions/` with `internal: true` in their SKILL.md frontmatter are excluded from bundled skills (not included in `bundled-skills.ts`).

Currently internal skills:
- `uloop-get-project-info`
- `uloop-get-version`

When updating README documentation about bundled skills count, remember to exclude internal skills from the count.
